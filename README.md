# Penmig

We dont have to worry about migration is development any more. 
This gem will create an initializer file which will run all the migrations in our project 
file. At the time of loading you development server it will run the migrations and then starts your 
server

Currently if we have pending migrations , we can't identify at the time of booting the development 
server. It will be only notfied at the time of redirecting the pages. penmig helps to avoid that.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile in group :development

```ruby
gem 'penmig'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle
## Usage

to create the generator file , use

    $ rails g penmig

to destory the generator file

    $ rails d penmig

## Development

case. please put mails in anoob.bava@gmail.com
